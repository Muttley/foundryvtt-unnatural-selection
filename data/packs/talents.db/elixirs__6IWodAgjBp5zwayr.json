(See @UUID[Compendium.unnatural-selection.documents.JournalEntry.4G9LZfiREUuQViCf.JournalEntryPage.pner3NgfU4oKKvjT]{Delivery Method} table).If you fail, you can’t make that elixir again until you rest. Except for mask infusions, elixirs expire in 5 rounds. Critical success increases DC or die category by one. Critical fails self-inflict harmful elixers.</p><p></p><p>You can use the table on pg. 27 of <em>Cursed Scroll #2</em> to craft more elixirs. These poisons require a DC 14 INT check. Refer to the “use” column for the delivery method modifier. Note the commonality of the ingredients and check with your GM to ensure availability.</p>",
